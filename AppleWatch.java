/*
 * Abstract Class names starts with UpperCase like a regular class.
 * An abstract class is a superclass that cannot be instantiated (canâ€™t create objects)
 * Contains both abstract and non abstract methods.
 * Abstract method can not be implemented, can be defined (declared) only.
 * Non abstract methods can be implemented, but can not be defined (declared).
 * An abstract class can inherit only one abstract class or one regular class by extends keyword
 * An abstract class can't inherit an Interface by extends keyword.
 * An Abstract class can inherit Interface by implements keyword.
 * An abstract class cannot inherit a regular class or abstract class by implements keyword.
 * Inside Abstract class, variable can be declared or initialized.
 * We can Declare a Constructor inside Abstract class.
 * Abstract Class cannot be instantiated but by the help of  concrete class, it can be instantiated.
 * This is "mandatory to put abstract keyword" with the abstract method inside Abstract Class.
 * This is the norm/rules to "write at least one abstract method" inside abstract class.
